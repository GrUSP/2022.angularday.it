  speaker_role: "Lead Developer @ SparkFabrik"
  speaker_bio: "I am a full-stack developer and team leader, graduated in Computer Science when we were still talking about Web 2.0 and the reference JS library was script.aculo.us, then started freelancing working mainly on Drupal and, as last act of my solo career, worked on the new Iperbole portal for the municipality of Bologna.
    Eventually I embraced the SparkFabrik project, became a Lead Developer, shifted the focus to the Frontend, first Angular then React, and bootstrapped a new React Native unit.
    My main focus is still engineering, but there's more: I like to create relations, tech content, talks, videos, blog posts, and I host the Continuous Delivery podcast."

        talk_description: "The main use-case for using Dynamic Components is when we can decide only in run-time which component is loaded. They’re also the only solution when we want to embed Angular components in non-Angular ones. In many cases, replacing in-template components with dynamic ones is beneficial to performance and code quality.
        In this talk we’ll learn how to create and use Dynamic Components, and discuss several types of usages."

        talk_description: "Angular has found wide adoption in the enterprise space. Big companies love Angular because it comes with conventions and excellent tooling.
        There needs to be some proper architectural foundation, which becomes even more evident as your application grows and you have more team members working on it.
        Spaghetti code and interdependencies among app features, as well as build and serve times going from seconds to minutes, are common symptoms of large-scale Angular apps which significantly impact the team's productivity and morale.
        This talk will outline an architectural approach to solve such issues, at horizontal vs. vertical slicing of Angular apps and how Webpack's Module Federation can help."

        Your projects are not well structured or do you need to split better your code?
        Using NX all of these problems can be resolved.
        In this talk, I'll show you how you can improve the developer experience of your team by introducing NX."

        talk_description: "The Test Pyramid should be a well-known metaphor of grouping tests in buckets, with unit tests at the base and E2E at the top.
        But this concept has led over the years to invest heavily in the former and often ignore the latter, while a good end-to-end test suite is what saves the day in difficult times.
        In this talk I'll explain what Cypress is, how to best integrate it with Angular, and how to configure it in a CI/CD pipeline on GitHub."
